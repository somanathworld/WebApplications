Polymorphism
- Poly means many
- Morphos means forms
- It is technique that allows a component to work for various situations.
- Creating an object that can work for various situations.
- You can overload the memory for object and you can configure various functionalities for object.

Ex:
<script>
    class Employee
    {
        FirstName;
        LastName;
        Designation;
        Print(){
            document.write(`${this.FirstName} ${this.LastName} - ${this.Designation}<br>`);
        }
    }
    class Developer extends Employee
    {
        FirstName = "Raj";
        LastName = "Kumar";
        Designation = "Developer";
        Role = "Developer Role : Build, Debug, Test, Deploy";
        Print(){

        JavaScript Browser Objects
1. window
2. location
3. navigator
4. history
5. document

window: It provides a set of properties and methods that are used
              control browser window.

    open()
    close()
    print()

Ex:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Browser Object</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <a href="javascript:window.open('../public/images/shoe.jpg','Nike','width=400 height=400')">
            <img src="../public/images/shoe.jpg" width="50" height="50">
            <p>Click to open in new window</p>
        </a>
        <button onclick="window.close()">Close</button>
        <button onclick="window.print()">Print Page</button>
    </body>
</html>


Location Object:
- It provides properties and methods to get client location details

    host        : returns server name or IP
    protocol        : returns protocol, http:, file:
    port        : returns port number
    href        : get and set complete url
    pathName        : returns only path
    hash        : returns current hash "#" location
    search        : returns query string

Ex:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Browser Object</title>
        <script>
            function GetDetails(){

                    document.write("<h1>You are accessing page from Web Server</h1>");
                } else {
                    document.write("<h1>You are not using Web Server - It is a File Server </h1>");
                }
                document.write(`
                    Server Name / IP : ${location.host} <br>
                    Protocol         : ${location.protocol} <br>
                    Port Number      : ${location.port} <br>
                    URL              : ${location.href} <br>
                    Path Name        : ${location.pathname}
                `);
            }
        </script>
    </head>
    <body>
        <button onclick="GetDetails()">Get Location Details</button>
    </body>
</html>

Ex: Href can get and set
    location.href    // getter
    location.href=path    // setter
