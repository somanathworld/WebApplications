FAQ: Can we make background image transparent?
Ans:  No. You can't set transparent image.
         You have to configure background with a cover that can be transparent using "rgba()"

Ex:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Background</title>
        <style>
           body {
               background-image: url("../public/images/netflixback.jpg");
               background-size: cover;
           }
           .body-cover {
               width: 110%;
               height: 700px;
               background-color: rgba(0,0,0,0.6);
               margin-top: -30px;
               margin-left: -30px;

           }
        </style>
    </head>
    <body>
       <div class="body-cover">

       </div>
    </body>
</html>

FAQ: Can we define multiple background colors?
Ans : Yes. By using Gradient Colors
          Background multiple colors are applied by using
        "background-image"

          Gradiants are 2 types
        a) linear gradient        horizontal and vertical
        b) radial gradient        from center

     Syntax:
        body {
          background-image: linear-gradient(to right, red, yellow);
        }

Ex:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Background</title>
        <style>
           .body-cover {
               height: 600px;
               width: 100%;
               background-image:radial-gradient(black,rgba(255,255,255,0.8)) ;
           }
           body {
               background-image: url("../public/images/netflixback.jpg");
           }
        </style>
    </head>
    <body>
       <div class="body-cover">

       </div>
    </body>
</html>

FAQ: Can we change background image and color according to situation?
Ans:  Yes. By using "@media()" queries

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Background</title>
        <style>
           @media screen and (orientation:landscape){
               body{
                   background-image: url("../public/images/netflixback.jpg");
                   background-size: cover;
               }
           }
           @media screen and (orientation:portrait){
               body{
                   background-image: url("../public/images/netflixportrait.jfif");
                   background-size: cover;
               }
