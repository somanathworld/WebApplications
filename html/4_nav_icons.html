    Henrietta Rodman (August 29, 1877 – March 21, 1923) was an American educator and feminist who was active in
    advocating on behalf of married women teachers for their right to promotion and maternity leave. She taught English
    and was a vocational counselor at Wadleigh High School for Girls in New York City. Opposed to the school board's
    restrictive policies on married women teachers, she married a psychologist friend, Herman de Fremery, in 1913, and
    announced it to the press, saying: "If the married state affects a woman's work, the authorities can mark her
    accordingly. If it does not affect her work, and if she is as good a teacher as she was before, she deserves
    promotion, if it comes to her." Rodman's bohemian public persona was considered to be eccentric at best: she wore
    sack-like dresses and sandals long before they were in fashion; her hair was bobbed and she smoked cigarettes. She
    threw crowded dinner parties in her top-floor apartment; Mary Hunter Austin recalled attending one such dinner, and
    meeting James Weldon Johnson there. This photograph of Rodman was taken around the early 1910s.
